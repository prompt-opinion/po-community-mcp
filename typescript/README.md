# Local development

Start with `npm install`.

And then run `npm run start`.

# Debugging with vscode

We use [tsx](https://tsx.is/vscode) to debug the server locally. To debug in vscode:

- (Optional) Add your breakpoints in vscode now. You can always do this later.
- Ensure `index.ts` is opened and it is the current active tab.
- On the left hand navigation pane in vscode, select the `Run and Debug` tab.
- Ensure `tsx` is the selected configuration in the dropdown.
- Click on the green play (Start Debugging) button.
